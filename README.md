- 👀 I’m interested in vintage computers, demomaking, algorithmics and a lot of geek things in the real world !
- 🌱 I’m currently learning compression algorithms, growing mushrooms, and making my own Lichtenberg figures
- 💞️ I’m willing to collaborate on any emulator or vintage computer programming topics
